# Further development

- Make a Redux Provider for the state
- Decide on using either Tailwind or Styled Components
  > I started using Tailwind, but have since started using Styled Components
- Make better use of types for TypeScript for the block components
  > The implementation of blocks for article are too JavaScript'y
- Investigate on the use of API keys for Notion
  > It sounds overkill to make a proxy
- Use a map for routes
- Use a `Props` interface for components
- Add ESLint for TypeScript
- Be consistent on the use of CSS units

# Bugs
